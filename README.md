# My Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal projects portfolio.

This repository serves as a central hub where you can find information and links to the various projects I have worked on (some projects are private). These projects act as practical evidence of my qualifications and hands-on experience in **Cybersecurity Operations, Telecommunications Systems, Networking, Cloud Technologies, Technical Support, and Programming**.

Each project highlights a different aspect of my skill set and demonstrates my ability to apply the knowledge and experience gained throughout my career growth to solve real-world technical challenges.

The projects cover the following domains:

* **Telecommunications** – Reflects the knowledge built from my Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering foundation.
* **Networking** – Demonstrates growing infrastructure design, configuration, and optimization competence.
* **Security** – Showcases defensive, analytical, and incident-response skills developed through continuous cybersecurity operations and labs.
* **Cloud** – Represents skills acquired through cloud computing learning paths and modern enterprise security practices.
* **Programming** – Highlights an automation-driven and scalability-focused mindset through practical tool and script development.


Most of these projects are stored in private repositories, but I've provided a snapshot of what each project entails. Feel free to explore and learn more about each one!
